Where the fee is a subscription, we may, in our sole discretion, change the fee to be charged for your next subscription period, provided we first notify you by email in accordance with applicable law. Where the fee is for something other than a subscription, we will notify you in advance of any rate changes. \n                        All fees are payable in accordance with the payment terms in effect when payment is due. We may offer some promotional trials or time-limited discounts or offers for certain Services or Users from time to time. If you sign up or register through a trial, promotional, or discount event, your rights of use will be subject to and limited by the terms of the trial, promotion, or discount offer and will terminate or renew in accordance with the terms of the offer or any additional terms communicated related to the trial, promotion, or discount offer. If you do not pay fees applicable to the Services you may not use or access those paid Services features. Unless otherwise expressly stated in the policies applicable to a Service, any fees paid for Services are non-refundable, to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Where a Service has a fee, you must use either a credit card or other acceptable or approved payment method (such as through a third-party app store, when you purchase a Service through our app) to activate and maintain that Service. You will be responsible for the fees and all applicable taxes for any Service ordered. If we do not receive payment from your credit card or payment method, you agree to pay all amounts due hereunder upon demand and will be solely responsible for any dispute with your payment provider. Should your credit card or payment method be denied, we reserve the right to recharge the credit card or payment method for any outstanding amounts. You will not be charged more than the amount of the fees for the Service(s) you have purchased. \n                        PrepAnywhere does not directly store credit card information as all credit card information and transactions are stored by third-party payment providers that process payments such as Stripe on our behalf.

When applicable, your subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel your account prior to the renewal date through the procedures described in the “Subscription Cancellation” section below. We will charge your credit card (or the other method of payment initially used by you) each year, month or other applicable period (depending on the payment term that you selected) for the then-current applicable price. You authorize us to charge you through the credit card or other acceptable or approved payment method that you used when subscribing to the Services. \n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        For consumers residing in Quebec: All subscriptions are offered for an indeterminate term.

If you do so, we will endeavor to close your account as soon as possible; regardless, we will not charge you for another subscription period if you cancel your subscription prior to its renewal date.

Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these “photosensitive epileptic seizures” while using digital screens. You and your Students should immediately stop using the Services and consult a doctor if you or they experience any symptoms such as lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. Parents and Teachers should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms. If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing video games or other screen-focused activities.\n</p>\n<h4>Privacy </h4>\n<p>\nFor information about PrepAnywhere’s treatment of personal information, please review our current Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference. \n</p>\n                    <p>\nWhere a U.S.-based Teacher User agrees to this Agreement on behalf of their educational institution, PrepAnywhere agrees that it is under the direct control of the educational institution with regard to that institution’s Students’ personally identifiable information as defined under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), except to the extent that a Student is linked with a Parent User who then will have the ability to consent to further use of the Student’s personally identifiable information.

PrepAnywhere does not use personal information collected from Students to individually target this advertising, and does not allow third-party targeted advertising providers to place cookies on or collect information from the PrepAnywhere game or other areas of the Services directed to Students.\n    </p>\n\n<h4>Third-party services</h4>\n<p>\nThe Services may contain links to third-party websites or services (“Third-Party service(s)”) not owned or controlled by PrepAnywhere such as YouTube, or our Services may be accessed by logging in through a Third-Party service (i.e. Google).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief at any time. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts of Ontario.\n</p>\n                    <p>\nFor all other Users: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws principles. \n</p>\n<h4>Arbitration and dispute resolution; class action waiver</h4>\n                    <p>\nThis provision allows us to promptly and efficiently resolve any dispute that may arise between us. You and PrepAnywhere agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim under any legal theory, including but not limited to any federal or state statutory claims, common law claims, including those based in tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or contract, arising out of or relating in any way to the Services or these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, formation, or the validity thereof, and the issue of arbitrability (collectively, the Dispute), you and PrepAnywhere agree to the following resolution process. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, conscionability, severance, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the substantive law applicable to any arbitration, any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.\n</p>\n                    <p>\nThe parties agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcome. The parties therefore agree that, before either party demands arbitration against the other, we will personally meet and confer, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to resolve informally any claim covered by this arbitration agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference. The party initiating the claim must give notice to the other party in writing of their intent to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, which shall occur within 30 days after the other party receives such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. To notify PrepAnywhere that you intend to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, write to PrepAnywhere at info@prepanywhere.com or by mail ATTN: PrepAnywhere at 8 Heintzman Crescent, Maple, ON, L6A 4T8, providing your name, the contact information by which to reach you, a description of your claim, and a proposed resolution. Engaging in an informal dispute resolution conference is a condition precedent that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration, and the Arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration demand filed before completion of an informal dispute resolution conference.\n</p>\n                    <p>\nIf you and PrepAnywhere do not reach an agreed-upon resolution within 30 days of the meet and confer, you and PrepAnywhere agree that the Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or retired judge, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. In resolving the Dispute, the arbitrator will consider applicable law, the provisions of this Agreement, and any facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned decision.\n</p>\n                    <p>\nA. Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution. In arbitration, the arbitrator will resolve the submitted Dispute. WITH ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY; THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES; AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules, but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all such fees and costs in order for this arbitration agreement to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered into any court that has jurisdiction over the parties.\n</p>\n                    <p>\nB. Small Claims Matters Are Excluded. As an exception to binding arbitration, you and PrepAnywhere both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any Dispute that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis. We will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual Dispute that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the Dispute is pending only in that court.\n</p>\n                    <p>\nC. Injunctive Relief. This arbitration agreement will not apply to any legal action taken by either party to seek an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.\n</p>\n                    <p>\nD. Timing of Claim. To help resolve any Disputes promptly, you and PrepAnywhere agree that any notice of intent to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, or any small claims or injunctive relief complaint permitted under this Agreement must be filed, within one year after the events giving rise to the Dispute arise; otherwise, the Dispute is waived.\n</p>\n                    <p>\nE. No Class Actions. You and PrepAnywhere agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. You and PrepAnywhere further agree that any Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. Also, the arbitrators may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).\n</p>\n                    <p>\nF. Opt-out.
